Here are the steps to set up a project on VS Community and set up PRs.

Step 1: Set up Repository 

    First create the project 

        -Go to VS Community, and create a new project 

        -Select the the API template. 

        -Come up with a name for our project 

    Set up the project files 

        -In clean architecture, each project file besides the Solution gets a name that designates what it is. So for the API project file we already have, rename it to “<nameyoupicked>.API”. We are going to add the name of each layer onto the end of the project file name. 

        -Next, double click the solution file and scroll down to “add”, and click “new project” 

        -We are going to need one console app template called <nameyoupicked>.Application 

        -Another console app called <nameyoupicked>.Data 

        -Another console app called <nameyoupicked>.Domain 

        -And a final project in the Sql Server Database project template called <nameyoupicked>.SqlServerDatabase 

    Set up the the repository 

        -go to git changes in the document and follow the steps to create a repo. It can be found at the very top under the git tab, or at the bottom left under the git changes tab 

        -Click the “create git repository” button 

        -Change visibility from private to public 

        -Press create and push 

Step 2: How to enable pull requests 
     
     Go to the repository on GitHub 

        -Click on the “settings” tab 

        -Scroll down to the “branches” section 

        -Click on “add rule” 
    
        -In the “branch name pattern” box, type in “main” 
    
        -Check the box that says “Require pull request reviews before merging” 
        
        -Check the box that says “Require status checks to pass before merging” 
        
        -Click on “Create” at the bottom of the page
